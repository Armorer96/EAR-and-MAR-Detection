Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) and Mouth Aspect Ratio(MAR) detection using Python and Facial landmark predictors.

Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) and Mouth Aspect Ratio(MAR) can be used to identify-

1.Facial expression of a person classified based on observed EAR and MAR values.
2.Drowsiness detection while dirving
3.Behaviour of driver i.e attentive while driving using MAR ratio

Pre-trained face-shape decriptors which are trained using DNN  and used using 
dlib library in OpenCV are used to identify eyes and mouth through descriptors
generated.
